<a name="3.0.0"></a>
# [3.0.0](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/compare/v2.1.4...v3.0.0) (2017-09-28)

### Breaking Changes
The `webpack` config format changed from being a config that is exported to being a dictionary of configs. Basically, the default config now exports a `dev` and `prod` property with a config assigned to each. See an example of the change [here](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/config/webpack.config.js#L143-L146). This change is setting the stage for adding multiple "environment" support for the next app-scripts release.

### New Features
This release adds support for `ngo`, the Angular team's build optimizer tool. `ngo` is enabled by default on `--prod` builds. In the event that `ngo` is not working for your app or something goes wrong, it can be disabled by running the following build command.

```
ionic cordova build ios --aot --minifyjs --minifycss --optimizejs
```

Using the `--aot` flag enables the `AoT Compiler`. `--minifyjs` and `--minifycss` minify the outputted code.

### Notes
Version `3.0.0` deprecated support for Rollup, Closure Compiler, and Babili. The support for these was poor and they were not used by many developers. `uglifyjs` was replaced with the newer `uglifyes`, which supports ES2015.

### Bug Fixes

* **aot:** normalize paths to fix path issues on windows ([b766037](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/b766037))
* **build:** scan deeplink dir too if different from srcDir ([8929265](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/8929265))
* **deep-linking:** convert deep linking to use TS Transform. DeepLinking now works on TypeScript src instead of on transpiled JS code ([63c4c7f](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/63c4c7f))
* **deep-linking:** remove IonicPage import statement in transform/non-transform approachs to work better with strict TS settings ([84d9ec7](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/84d9ec7))
* **devapp:** do not enable shake ([#1215](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/issues/1215)) ([118189c](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/118189c))

## [2.0.2](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/compare/v2.0.1...v2.0.2) (2017-07-13)

## Upgrading
Make sure you follow the instructions below for upgrading from `1.x` to `2.x`. In the `2.0.2` release, we had to make a small change to the `optimization` config. If you override this config, please review the [change](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/785e044) and update your config accordingly.

### Bug Fixes

* **sass:** fix potential null pointer, though it really should never happen ([427e556](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/427e556))
* **webpack:** don't output deptree.js, this requires a minor tweak to the optimization config if you have it customized ([785e044](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/785e044))
* **webpack:** upgrade to webpack 3.2.0 to fix some bugs within Webpack surrounding the ModuleConcatenationPlugin ([f85ade0](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/f85ade0))



<a name="2.0.1"></a>
## [2.0.1](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1) (2017-07-11)

## Upgrading from 1.x

If you're upgrading directly from `1.3.12` or earlier, make sure you review the changelog for `2.0.0` and follow the [instructions here](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/releases/tag/v2.0.0). There were some very minor updates you'll need to make to your app.

If you're customizing the build process and have a dependency that utilized `webpack@2.x`, it may be best to add an explicit `devDependency` on `webpack@3.1.0` to the project's `package.json` file. There have been a couple reports of non-standard 3rd party dependencies causing trouble with the `webpack` version.

### Bug Fixes

* **generators:** no module by default ([#1096](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/issues/1096)) ([dfcaefa](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/dfcaefa))
* **http-server:** revert change for path-based routing since it broke proxies ([065912e](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/065912e))
* **sass:** use webpack/rollup modules for non-optimized build, use optimization data for prod/optimized buids ([0554201](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/0554201))
* **serve:** fix cached file issue by only using the webpack module concat plugin for prod builds, make sure you update custom configs ([feea7fe](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/feea7fe))
* **webpack:** webpack in-memory output file system was breaking some plugins ([574da39](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/574da39))



<a name="2.0.0"></a>
# [2.0.0](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/compare/v1.3.12...v2.0.0) (2017-07-07)

### Breaking Changes

In order to speed up the bundling process, we have separated `node_modules` code into a new, generated file called `vendor.js`. This means that on every change, `ionic-angular`, `@angular`, etc won't need to be processed by `webpack` :tada:

This means that `src/index.html` must be modified to include a new vendor script tag `<script src="build/vendor.js"></script>`. This new script tag must be placed above the `main.js` script tag. For example,

```
...
<body>

  <!-- Ionic's root component and where the app will load -->
  <ion-app></ion-app>

  <script src="cordova.js"></script>

  <!-- The polyfills js is generated during the build process -->
  <script src="build/polyfills.js"></script>

  <!-- all code from node_modules directory is here -->
  <script src="build/vendor.js"></script>

  <!-- The bundle js is generated during the build process -->
  <script src="build/main.js"></script>

</body>
...
```

Another side effect of this change is if you are overriding the `webpack` configuration, you will want to update your custom configuration based on the [new default configuration](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/config/webpack.config.js). The main changes to the config are adding the `ModuleConcatenationPlugin` for scope hoisting for significantly faster apps, and adding the common chunks plugin for the `vendor.js` bundle.

See commits [e14f819](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/e14f819) and [141cb23](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/141cb23) for the specifics of the `webpack.config.js` change.

### Bug Fixes

* **lint:** improve linting performance ([106d82c](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/106d82c))

# [1.1.0](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/compare/v1.0.1...v1.1.0) (2017-02-11)

### Optimizations
We are starting to introduce optimizations to improve the size of the `bundle` generated by the build process.

The first set of optimizations are behind flags:

`ionic_experimental_manual_treeshaking` will remove Ionic components and code that are not being used from the bundle.
`ionic_experimental_purge_decorators` helps tree shaking by removing unnecessary `decorator` metadata from AoT code.

Since these are experimental, we are looking for feedback on how the work. Please test them out and [let us know](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/issues) how it goes. See the instructions [here](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts#custom-configuration).

## [0.0.47](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/compare/v0.0.46...v0.0.47) (2016-12-12)

### Upgrade Instructions

#### Install latest Ionic CLI
Install the latest ionic cli. `sudo` may be required depending upon your `npm` set-up.

```
npm install -g ionic@latest
```

#### Entry Point Changes
Delete `main.dev.ts` and `main.prod.ts` and create a `main.ts` file with the following content:

```
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';

import { AppModule } from './app.module';

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
```

#### Dev Builds By Default Changes
All builds are now development (non-AoT) builds by default. This allows for a better development experience when testing on a device. To get started, please follow the steps below.

Make sure the `scripts` section of `package.json` looks like this:

```
  "scripts": {
    "ionic:build": "ionic-app-scripts build",
    "ionic:serve": "ionic-app-scripts serve"
  }
```

`ionic run android --prod` will do a production build that utilizes AoT compiling and minifaction.
`ionic emulate ios --prod` will do a production build that utilizes AoT compiling and minifaction.
`ionic run android` will do a development build
`ionic emulate ios` will do a development build

If you wish to run AoT but disable minifaction, do the following
`ionic run android --aot`
`ionic emulate ios --aot`


#### Source Map Changes
Change `ionic_source_map` to `ionic_source_map_type` in package.json if it is overridden.

#### Config Changes
There were significant improvements/changes to most configs. Please review the changes and make sure any custom configs are up to date.

#### Validate TSConfig settings
Verify that `tsconfig.json` is up to date with recommended settings:

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "declaration": false,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "lib": [
      "dom",
      "es2015"
    ],
    "module": "es2015",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "target": "es5"
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*.ts"
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules"
  ],
  "compileOnSave": false,
  "atom": {
    "rewriteTsconfig": false
  }
}
```


### Breaking Changes
1. `main.dev.ts` and `main.prod.ts` have been deprecated in favor of `main.ts` with the content of `main.dev.ts`. The content of `main.ts` will be optimized at build time for production builds.
2. Builds are now always development (non-AoT) by default. To enable `prod` builds, use the `--prod` option.
3. `copy.config` and `watch.config` have breaking changes moving to an easier-to-extend configuration style.
4. `copy.config` uses `node-glob` instead of `fs-extra` to do the copy. Migrate from directory/files to globs in any custom configs.
5. `ionic_source_map` configuration has been changed to `ionic_source_map_type`.
6. Source maps now use `source-map` devtool option by default instead of `eval`. Change `ionic_source_map_type` option to return to the faster building `eval`.

## Upgrade Steps
To use this version of `@ionic/app-scripts`, follow these steps to upgrade:

1. Install the latest version of the ionic cli

  ```
    npm install ionic@latest -g
  ```

  Note: sudo may be required depending on your workstation set-up

2. Update the project's `package.json` file's `script` section to look like this:

  ```
  ...
  "scripts" : {
    "ionic:build": "ionic-app-scripts build",
    "ionic:serve": "ionic-app-scripts serve"
  }
  ...
  ```

  Note: This is removing several deprecated Ionic scripts. If you have any of your own custom scripts, don't remove them.


3. Install the latest version of `@ionic/app-scripts`

  ```
  npm install @ionic/app-scripts@latest --save-dev
  ```

### Breaking Changes

`ionic_source_map` variable is now used to drive the `devtool` (sourcemap) value for webpack. It now defaults to `eval` for faster builds. Set it to `source-map` for `typescript` sourcemaps.

* **sourcemaps:** webpack .ts sourcemaps ([bfca1be](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/bfca1be))
* **webpack:** modify config to use IONIC_APP_SCRIPTS_DIR variable ([2b7c606](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/2b7c606))


### Features
* **events:** emit bundler events ([8d73da9](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/8d73da9))
* **exports:** add templateUpdate and fullBuildUpdate ([a31897d](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/a31897d))
* **webpack source maps:** make it easy to configure source map type ([03565b7](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/commit/03565b7))
